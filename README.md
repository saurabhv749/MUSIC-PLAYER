# Music Player (_using Javascript DOM manipulation_)

## Don't forget to

> add folders _covers_ and _songs_

> rename every file in the format file01.jpg & file01.mp3

## Concepts

    - DOM manipulation
    - CSS-> animation-play-state Property
    - audio tags -> audio.play(),audio. pause(),audio.currentTime,audio.duration
    - Qurey selectors (ECMAScript)
    - EventListeners

## Approach

    HTML has the initial setup for first file and rest is handled by JS using click events
